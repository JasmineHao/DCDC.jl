abstract = {A semiparametric model for observational data combines a parametric form for some component of the data generating process (usually the behavioral relation between the dependent and explanatory variables) with weak nonparametric restrictions on the remainder of the model (usually the distribution of the unobservable errors). This chapter surveys some of the recent literature on semiparametric methods, emphasizing microeconometric applications using limited dependent variable models. An introductory section defines semiparametric models more precisely and reviews the techniques used to derive the large-sample properties of the corresponding estimation methods. The next section describes a number of weak restrictions on error distributions — conditional mean, conditional quantile, conditional symmetry, independence, and index restrictions — and show how they can be used to derive identifying restrictions on the distributions of observables. This general discussion is followed by a survey of a number of specific estimators proposed for particular econometric models, and the chapter concludes with a brief account of applications of these methods in practice.},

abstract = {When one wants to estimate a model without specifying the functions and distributions parametrically, or when one wants to analyze the identification of a model independently of any particular parametric specification, it is useful to perform a nonparametric analysis of identification. This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.},

@misc{Chen2007,
abstract = {Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with identi{\ldots}cation of discrete games of incomplete information when we allow for three types of unobservables: payo¤-relevant variables, both players' private information and common knowledge; and non-payo¤-relevant variables that determine the selection between multiple equilibria. The speci{\ldots}cation of the payo¤ function and the distributions of the common knowledge unobservables is nonparametric with {\ldots}nite support (i.e., {\ldots}nite mixture model). We provide necessary and su¢ cient conditions for the identi{\ldots}cation of all the primitives of the model. Two types of conditions play a key role in our identi{\ldots}cation results: independence between players'private information, and an exclusion restriction in the payo¤ function. When using a sequential identi{\ldots}cation approach, we {\ldots}nd that the up-to-label-swapping identi{\ldots}cation of the {\ldots}nite mixture model in the {\ldots}rst step creates a problem in the identi{\ldots}cation of the payo¤ function in the second step: unobserved types have to be correctly matched across di¤erent values of observable explanatory variables. We show that this matching-types problem appears in the sequential estimation of other structural models with nonparametric {\ldots}nite mixtures. We derive necessary and su¢ cient conditions for identi{\ldots}cation, and show that additive separability of unobserved heterogeneity in the payo¤ function is a su¢ cient condition to deal with this problem.

Taking the perspective of random forests as an adaptive kernel method, we pair the forest kernel with a local linear regression adjustment to better capture smoothness. The resulting procedure, local linear forests, enables us to improve on asymptotic rates of convergence for random forests with smooth signals, and provides substantial gains in accuracy on both real and simulated data.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for performing estimation and inference in econometric models with partial identification, focusing particularly on models characterized by moment inequalities and equalities. Applications of this framework include the analysis of game-theoretic models, revealed preference restrictions, regressions with missing and corrupted data, auction models, structural quantile regressions, and asset pricing models. Specifically, we provide estimators and confidence regions for the set of minimizers OI of an econometric criterion function Q(O). In applications, the criterion functio embodies testable restrictions on economic models. A parameter value 0 that describe an economic model satisfies these restrictions if Q(0) attains its minimum at this value Interest therefore focuses on the set of minimizers, called the identified set. We use the inversion of the sample analog, Q,(O), of the population criterion, Q(0), to construc estimators and confidence regions for the identified set, and develop consistency, rates of convergence, and inference results for these estimators and regions. To derive thes results, we develop methods for analyzing the asymptotic properties of sample criterio functions under set identification.},

@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {We develop a tractable and applicable dynamic model of network formation with transfers in the presence of externalities. Our primary application is the estimation of primitives and prediction of counterfactual outcomes in bilateral oligopoly and buyer-seller networks. The framework takes as primitives each agent's static profits, and provides the equilibrium recurrent class of networks and negotiated transfers. Importantly, agents anticipate future changes to the network, and links may be costly to form, maintain, or break. We detail the computation and es-timation of a Markov-Perfect equilibrium in this environment, and highlight the approach using simulated data motivated by insurer-hospital negotiations. We explore the impact of hospital mergers on negotiated payments, insurer premiums, and consumer welfare, and demonstrate how accounting for dynamics yields substantively different predictions than traditional static approaches.},
