\section{The baseline model}

The utility function is defined as:
\[ u(c_{h,t},l_{h,t},P_{h,t}) = \frac{M^{1-\gamma}_{h,t}}{1 - \gamma} \exp{(\xi P_{h,t} + \pi z_{h,t} + \zeta_{h,t} )} .\]
The preference aggregator (why aggregator) for hours of leisure and consumption is
\[ M_{h,t}(c_{h,t},l_{h,t};z_{h,t},\chi_{h,t}) = \left( \frac{(c_{h,t}^{1 - \phi} - 1)}{1 - \phi} + (\alpha_{h,t}(z_{h,t},\chi_{h,t})) \frac{(l_{h,t}^{1 - \theta} -1)}{ 1 - \theta}\right) \]
$\alpha_{h,t}= \exp{(\psi_0 + \psi_z z_{h,t} + \chi_{h,t})}$

Suppose for now there is no random discrete choice, the inter-temporal budget constraint:
\[ A_{h,t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) \left( A_{h,t} + \left(w_{h,t}^f(H-l_{h,t}) + y_{h,t}^m - c_{h,t} \right)\]
$A_{h,t}$ is the beginning asset holding, $r_t$ is the risk-free interest rate, $F$ is the fixed cost of work, dependent on the age of the youngest child, $a_{h,t}$. Female wages are given by $w_{h,t}^f$ and husband earning $y_{h,t}^m$.


\tbf{Random shocks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item No entry cost of labour market.
  \item The shock $\zeta$ induce increase of current period consumption/labour.
  \item Are $\zeta$ and $\chi$ correlated?
\end{itemize}

If there is a discrete choice to participate in labour market
\[ A_{h,t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) \left( A_{h,t} + \left(w_{h,t}^f(H-l_{h,t}) - F(a_{h,t}) \right)P_{h,t} + y_{h,t}^m - c_{h,t} \right)\]
